# Form-Creation-Validation

## Deep Dive into JavaScript: User Registration Form Validation

This project is the foundational task for the "Deep Dive into JavaScript" series, focusing on core concepts like **client-side form validation**, **DOM manipulation**, and **enhancing user experience** through real-time feedback.

### Project Goals (Learning Objectives)

By completing this project, the student demonstrates the ability to:

* **Implement Form Validation:** Validate user inputs (`username`, `email`, `password`) using basic JavaScript string methods and conditional logic.
* **Work with the DOM:** Select HTML elements and use event listeners to handle form submission.
* **Prevent Default Behavior:** Use `event.preventDefault()` to manage form submission clientside.
* **Provide Feedback:** Display dynamic, clear success or error messages to the user.

### Implemented Validation Rules

The following specific criteria are enforced upon form submission:

1.  **Username:** Must be **3 or more characters** long.
2.  **Email:** Must contain both the **`@`** symbol and a **`.`** (dot) character.
3.  **Password:** Must be **8 or more characters** long.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**

### How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repo URL]
    cd Form-Creation-Validation
    ```
2.  **Open the File:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3.  **Test:**
    Attempt to submit the form with valid and invalid data to see the validation messages.
